# Diffusion-based-Decoupled-Deterministic-and-Uncertain-Framework-for-Probabilistic-MTS-Forecasting
The repo is the official implementation for the paper: Diffusion-based-Decoupled-Deterministic-and-Uncertain-Framework-for-Probabilistic-MTS-Forecasting. 

We provide support for iTransformer as a point forecasting model in another project (https://github.com/Torea-L/D3U), 
where we will deliver long-term irregular updates for D3U. Thank you for your interest in D3U.


## Overall Architecture
![Logo](./figure/D3U.png)
## Usage
Train and evaluate the model. We provide all the above tasks under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the results as the following examples:
<div style="position: relative;">
  <pre>
    <code id="codeBlock">
# D3U Multivariate Probabilistic forecasting where SparseVQ functions as the conditioning network and PatchDN serves as the denoising
network.
bash ./scripts/SVQ/exp_study/
    </code>
  </pre>

  </button>
